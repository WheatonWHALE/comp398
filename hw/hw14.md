### Node.js and MongoDB

Follow along with ["A Basic introduction to Mongo DB"](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/1.4/api-articles/nodekoarticle1.html). When you feel comfortable with the Node.js library to interact with your MongoDB collection, write a JavaScript file, `populate.js` that either creates new or clears out an existing collection named `hw14` to generate and populate your collection with at least 2500 documents. Pick a compelling domain and flesh out interesting fake or real data.

Create a folder named `hw14` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* README.md file explaining the data contained in your collection
* `populate.js` that will delete your existing collection and populate it with a clean version of your data. Be mindful that your DB username and password will be exposed unless you make and refer to them as environment variables.
