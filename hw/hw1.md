# Homework 1

Implement &#8212; _in a language of your choice_ &#8212; an object-oriented, node-based linked list with minimal functionality of: 1) create an empty list; 2) add a single node to the end of the list; 3) populate the list from a flat file database; 4) search the list for a value; and 5) display a plaintext form of the list. Use your own judgement in determining return types and formatting.

Demonstrate the functionality of your linked list in a driver program using the data that you and your partner gathered in class.

Create a folder named `hw1` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* README file
* Source for your linked list
* Source for your driver program
* Flat file database
