# Homework 3


### Part 1
Make a complete copy of the contents of the `hw02` directory you were assigned into the `hw03` in your repository. Begin by following the README and attempt to run/compile/execute the existing code. Next, become familiar with the style guide referenced in the README. Your task is to create a document, `review.md`, that contains two major sections.

In the first section, `Style Guide Evaluation`, give detailed feedback about the source code, files, structure, etc. with respect to the style guide. Make sure that you include details about comments, variable naming, spacing, file i/o, etc.  That is, reference all the aspects used in the assignment.

In the second section, `Code Evaluation`, give detailed feedback about the code. Comment on the design, level of abstraction, issues that may arise at runtime, unchecked parameters, etc.

The `hw03` directory in your course repository should contain at least the following files (use appropriate filenames, extensions, capitalization, etc.):

* README file
* Source for your peer's linked list
* Source for your peer's driver program
* Peer's flat file database
* Plaintext output of running your peer's driver program
* **(new)** `review.md`
* **(new)** A second plaintext output file of you running your peer's program

### Part 2

From the _Do Now_ in class, store your attempt at displaying the weather data in a file, `weather.html`, as a page on your account's `github.io` site.
