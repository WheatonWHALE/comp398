# Homework 11

This is a pair assignment. Your task is to investigate a front-end framework. Consider the list at [CSS Front-end Framworks](http://usablica.github.io/front-end-frameworks/compare.html) and select one after doing some significant digging around in features, ease of use, and compatibility.

With your partner, come up with a novel idea for a site or a rethinking and improvement of some other site. After that, decide upon a domain name to register and determine an appropriate hosting setup (e.g., [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)).

Using the front-end framework from above, design a landing page for your site that showcases the front-end framework. Come prepared with a short (five minute) presentation for Thursday that details the front-end framework, demonstrates how you used the front-end framework in your site, and what your site it about.

Create a folder named `hw11` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* README.md file containing a link to your domain name
* Any presentation files needed for Thursday
