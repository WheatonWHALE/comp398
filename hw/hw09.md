# Homework 9

### Homework 6 Redux

Explore the web looking for data visualization inspiration starting with the following:


* Watch the first 20 or so minutes of Santiago Ortiz's OpenVis Conf 2013 talk on [Information Visualization Creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzDaNJZIVJA) and visit his [homepage](http://moebio.com/) to explore some examples
* Consult the [periodic table of visualization methods](http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html#)
* Look at some examples at [Information is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/), [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/), and [New York Times Data Visualization Lab](http://www.smallmeans.com/new-york-times-infographics/)

Your task is to produce a data visualization using the Wheaton College [course schedule](https://weblprod1.wheatonma.edu/PROD/bzcrschd.P_ListSection) as source material. In this particular assignment, focus on the Mathematics and Computer Science Department over the years currently available.

To build your data visualization, use HTML5, CSS, and SVG. Read [Tips for Creating Accessible SVG](http://www.sitepoint.com/tips-accessible-svg/) and ensure that your submission is accessible.

Create a folder named `hw09` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* `README.md`, a README Markdown file that includes mention of specific places where you made content/structure accessible 
* Source and/or description of what you used to extract data from the course schedule
* `schedule.html`, the HTML file containing your visualization and all SVG content
