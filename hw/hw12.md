### Part 2

Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to use in this part of the assignment.  That is, do not do any development for/in a browser. Implement &#8212; _in JavaScript_ &#8212; an object-oriented, node-based linked list with minimal functionality of: 1) create an empty list; 2) add a single node to the end of the list; 3) populate the list from a flat file database; 4) search the list for a value; and 5) display a plaintext form of the list. Use your own judgement in determining return types and formatting. Your code should abide by the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Demonstrate the functionality of your linked list in a driver program using the data that you and your partner gathered in class for hw01/02.

Create a folder named `hw12` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* README.md file
* Source for your linked list
* Source for your driver program
* Flat file database
* Plaintext output of running your driver program
