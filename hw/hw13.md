# Homework 13

### Homepage

Everyone has created their own `username.github.io` page. However, you now have a vast array of tools, technologies, frameworks, etc. at your disposal compared to your initial version. Using any/all/more of these, construct a next version of your site that you would feel comfortable sharing with a potential employer or graduate school.

### Portfolio 

As part of your site, you must have a component for your course portfolio. Details of the final portfolio will be forthcoming, but consider this an initial portfolio. Select three (3) different homework assignments, pull requests, or project contributions that you want to showcase. Create a portion of your site at `username.github.io/portfolio` that contains your best attempt at conveying your work to others. For example, you should link to specific repos, commits, or files, but you will also want visual and textual components that summarize your work. Consider that you may showcase over ten (10) specific pieces of work in your final portfolio, and you can use placeholders for the pieces beyond the initial three.

Create a folder named `hw13` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* README.md file containing a link to your homepage and a link to your portfolio page
