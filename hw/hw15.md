# Homework 15

### Readings

* [RESTful Web Services: A Tutorial](hw15_Dr._Dobbs_RESTful_Web_Services_2014.pdf)

### RESTful API

Using the collection you built in `hw14` as a start, envision 4-5 additional collections with related information to do with the domain. Construct appropriately named and structured URIs for the functionality you might want to provide with your data.

Create a folder named `hw15` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* `README.md` file explaining the domain and collections
* `URIs.md` that contains 10 proposed URIs and explanations about what each URI provides for all appropriate request verbs
* `request.md` that contains a fully fleshed out GET request using your original collection
