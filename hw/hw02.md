Make a complete copy of the contents of your `hw01` directory in a `hw02` directory. Your task is to first find a reputable style guide for the language you selected. Consider established tech companies and their published style guides as reputable. Next, adapt the code, filename, etc. in the `hw02` directory to completely abide by the style guide. Ensure that your code is sufficiently commented.

* README file &mdash; **(new)** include a hyperlink to your chosen style guide
* Source for your linked list
