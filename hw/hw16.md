# Homework 16

### Examination Redux

Revisit your examination submission folder and the examination folder in the course repo. Using my feedback and reviewing the examination questions, resolve any issues that remain with your submissions and improve on them.

Create a folder named `hw16` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* `README.md` file explaining the difference between the contents of your `exam` folder and this folder
* `prob1.html`, `prob2.html`, `prob3.html`, and `prob4.html`
