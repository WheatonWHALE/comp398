# Homework 7

### Part 1

Build a slide deck using [Bartek Szopka's impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) that you can use in a 10 minute presentation to the class. The presentation should demonstrate at least two things: 1) proficiency using HTML and CSS to craft an impress.js slide deck; and 2) complete understanding of your topic. You have been assigned a group of collaborators and a topic from the list below:

* Selectors (but not Pseudo-* Selectors)
* Pseudo-* Selectors (but not Selectors)
* Media Queries
* Distance and Color
* Fonts (but not Text)
* Text (but not Fonts)

Create a folder named `hw07` in your course repository that contains all files needed to present your impress.js slide deck. Everyone in your group should submit the exact same content to their repositories.

### Part 2

Finish your [FDA Nutrition Facts](http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/documents/image/ucm386494.jpg) in HTML, CSS, and/or SVG.

Create a subfolder of `hw07` named `FDA` that contains all files needed to view your nutrition facts label.
