# Homework 4

Implement &#8212; _in a language of your choice_ &#8212; a **basic** [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to HTML converter. Your converter should handle paragraphs, headers, block quotes, emphasis, lists, links, images, and code (see [Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)). 

Ensure that your converter code abides by an established style guide &#8212; include a link to it in the README file. Your program should not hard code input files within the source, but rather, should use command-line arguments to pass in the path to an input file.

Create a folder named `hw04` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* README Markdown file
* Source for your Markdown converter
* Source for your driver program
* Sample input Markdown file that exhaustively demonstrates your converter
* HTML output of running your driver program with the sample Markdown input
* HTML output of running your driver program with the README input
