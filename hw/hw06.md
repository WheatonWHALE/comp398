# Homework 6

### Part 1

Actively read the Mozilla Developer Network's tutorial on [Getting Started with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started). You are responsible for sections 1 through 14 (i.e., **What is CSS** through **Media**) by Tuesday.

Read the Web Accessibility Initiative's section on [Designing for Inclusion](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/Overview.html). After, peruse the W3C's document on [How to Meet WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/Overview.php) customized for HTML and CSS only.

### Part 2

Your task is to produce a data visualization using the Wheaton College [course schedule](https://weblprod1.wheatonma.edu/PROD/bzcrschd.P_ListSection) as source material.

To build your data visualization, use HTML5, CSS, and SVG.

Create a folder named `hw06` in your course repository that contains at least the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):

* `README.md`, a README Markdown file that includes references to the WCAG 2.0 
* Source and/or description of what you used to extract data from the course schedule
* `schedule.html`, the HTML file containing your visualization and all SVG content
