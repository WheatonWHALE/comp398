# Homework 10

The current GATRA map for [Wheaton T Shuttle/Route 140](http://www.gatra.org/index.php/routes/mansfield-norton/wheaton-t-shuttleroute-140/) could be improved. Your task is to create a GeoJSON data file named `gatra.geojson` -- read about GeoJSON and its full [specification](http://geojson.org/) -- that contains at least the following:

* the current path of the shuttle
* stop location and information
* dining, shopping, and entertainment venues accessible on the route
* non-stop landmarks or other points of interest

Use [GeoJSONLint](http://geojsonlint.com/) to view and validate your GeoJSON content. Also, GitHub will [nicely render](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github) your `.geojson` files.


### Part 2

Sign up for a free account at [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and either:

* download their [MapBox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) application for your platform. Follow along with the [quickstart](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/source-quickstart/) using the USGS earthquake data over the last 2.5 months.

**OR**

* use follow the green sections of [MapBox foundations](https://www.mapbox.com/foundations/) and do all of your work within the browser.

Irrespective of your choice, add your GeoJSON content as a layer in your map and publish it on your account. Those using the Studio software should be weary about too many tiles.

Create a folder named `hw10` in your course repository that contains at least the following files:

* README.md file that includes a link to your publicly available map
* `gatra.geojson`
