# Project 1

This is a pair project, and it is decidedly open ended in topic, scope, and direction. Your task is to build on the landing page site that you designed in homework 11. You should take this as an opportunity to challenge yourself to build something new and interesting.

* create and/or modify with attribution a substantial amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* use appropriate organization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and folders

* use icons (e.g., [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), [flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com/)) and design a [_favicon_](http://iconhandbook.co.uk/reference/chart/favicons/)
* comment code, structure, and style using established style guides and include references
* abide by accessibility standards
* create and load data from a GeoJSON or [JSON](http://json.org/) file
* include some form of web analytics (e.g., [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)) on each page of your site
* create a valid [`robots.txt`](http://www.robotstxt.org/) file
* ensure that your site is indexed by [Bing](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url) and [Google](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/)
* build a [sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/4581190)
* customize a [404](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) page

Create a folder named `proj01` in your course repository that contains **at least** the following files (use appropriate filenames and extensions):
