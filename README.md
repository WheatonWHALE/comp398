## Workload

It is the expectation for all classes taught at Wheaton College that one hour of class time may expect two to three hours of preparation outside of class.  In addition to preparation time, projects and homework are designed to take a significant amount of time per week.  Actively seek out additional learning materials, and start all assignments _early_. **No late work is accepted**.

## Academic Integrity

All work and submissions in this course must be entirely your own original content.  At the discretion of the instructor, violations of academic integrity will result in penalties up to and including failing the course and reporting the violation to the College Hearing Board. If you have general questions/concerns or specific instances to discuss, do not hesitate to ask in class or privately.

## Accommodation

In compliance with the Wheaton College policy and equal access laws, Dean Bellemore is available to discuss appropriate accommodations that may be recommended for students with disabilities. Requests for accommodations are to be made during the first two weeks of the semester so that timely and appropriate arrangements can be made. Students are required to register with Dean Bellemore, whose office is located in Kollett Hall, at the Filene Center for Academic Advising and Career Services. Contact x8215 to schedule an appointment, or email Dean Bellemore.
