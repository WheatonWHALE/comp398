# Peer Feedback

### Part 1

Using the [list of repos](https://github.com/WheatonWHALE/comp398/blob/master/student_repos.md) and treating it as a cycle (i.e., devindelfino follows akuisara), find your repo and note the **four (4)** repos following your own. You are responsible for providing substantive peer feedback on all homework assignments. The two installments of peer feedback must be completed by October 9th (i.e., hw01 -- hw10) and November 18th (i.e., hw11 -- hw20), respectively. 

For each of the repos that you are providing peer feedback, you are expected to:

* [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repos -- do not simple clone or browse
* work sequentially through each homework assignments comparing the work submitted with the work expected
* use the GitHub [**issues**](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) feature to open/close/comment while providing substantive feedback regarding the assignment submissions
* give descriptive titles to each issue (e.g., use the homework number and a comment) and/or add labels
* where appropriate, make a [**pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for errors and omissions that you can fix or complete
* continue participating in comment discussions about your contributions to other repos

### Part 2

After the October 9th and November 25th deadlines, go to your own repo and address **all** issues and pull requests that resulted from the peer feedback. You must work through and close any open issues and [merge pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request) -- with appropriate attribution -- as necessary. This must be completed by the end of classes, December 5th.
